I have experience migrating programming languages from Kotlin and Swift to React Native. I can create project schedules and build application from scratch.

I work at [Nalagenetics](https://nalagenetics.com) to build their mobile app user-friendly with _all the bells and whistles_ by delivering sophisticated features and optimising code structure.

I code mostly with **TypeScript** and JavaScript. But, I was accustomed to programming with Python and MATLAB during college. Now, my hands-on practical applications involve using **React Native, NextJS, ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, Redux, and RTK Query**.

Honestly, I am deeply into applied mathematics so much; that's why my educational background is in Mathematics. You know what the most common habits in software development are? All of them align perfectly with me:

- Problem solving
- Attention to detail
- Curiosity and continuous learning
- Writing algorithms, which is a logical sequence similar to writing a mathematical proof!

Above all, I do programming to develop innovative solutions to complex problems, while I'm in sync with my lifelong passion =)

Moreover, I am also well-equipped to contribute through my demonstrated research, communication, writing, and leadership skills, and to uphold the security and reliability of every project I undertake. Hence, I'm sure of my ability to be a valuable asset in bringing up ideas, finding creative solutions, and bug resolution for **your products and projects** in the future!
